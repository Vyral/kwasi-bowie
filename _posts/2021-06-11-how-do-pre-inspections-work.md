Today&nbsp; I’m starting a series I’ve titled “Hot Topics in Hot Markets.” Today’s topic is pre-inspections.

In a ridiculously hot market, like we have in Seattle, **the only difference between a pre-inspection and a regular inspection is when you get the inspection.** The inspections are the same, but in one case you have an accepted offer and in the other, you are not. The purpose of a pre-inspection is you spending the money upfront and doing what you have to do to get your offer accepted.

**Inspections are not pass/fail.** They are just telling you the condition of the house, and then you can decide whether you still want to buy it or not.

In a normal market, the buyer would do an inspection after mutual acceptance as part of the inspection contingency in their offer. I have talked with two people in two different markets who said that even though the market was hot, they were still able to do their inspection after mutual acceptance.

**In the ridiculously hot Seattle real estate market, however, you have to do a pre-inspection before you write the offer in most cases just to even have a chance\!**

So my pro tip of the day is if you are not going to get aggressive and write an offer that is going

to win, don’t waste your money on a pre-inspection.

If you want to do a FREE, no-obligation “Writing a Winning Offer” strategy session, just click the

link on the side of the page and schedule a time in my calendar. During this session, you will learn the strategies that are working in this market and find out which ones are right for you\! There is no obligation and no sales pitch, just a real conversation.

I hope you found this video informative. If you have any questions for me, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
