For some people, 4/20 is all about a certain green leaf. For me, though, April 20 is the perfect time to talk about another kind of green material—**money**. More specifically, how much money it takes to get a home in our market.

A lot of people have been asking me how high they need to go in order to win a home. I saw a meme that describes the situation perfectly (check 00:51 in the video). To put it bluntly, buyers need to offer amounts that are Snoop Dogg-levels of high. **It’s pretty accurate, too, as this is how many buyers feel in today’s market.**

Yes, bidding wars are real and aggressive. Yes, offers are going far above asking price. However, price is not the only factor that gets your offer accepted in Seattle and the surrounding market. To write a winning offer, you need to think about things like how much you’re putting in your earnest money deposit, whether it’s refundable, whether you’re getting a pre-inspection or waiving it, and whether you’re covering the difference between the offer price and the appraisal.

**These may sound scary, but it all comes down to calculated risks.** You have to take some chances in order to get the house you want, but keep in mind that you often aren’t losing anything. For example, earnest money goes toward your purchase price if you buy the house, and the money you’d use to cover appraisal differences can still go in your pocket.&nbsp;

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, real estate can be difficult to navigate. Hiring a professional can make the entire process much easier and ensure you walk away without spending a fortune. If you’re ready to jump into the market, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
