Today we’re back for another edition of “Hot Topics in Hot Markets” and we are discussing earnest money.&nbsp; I have discussed earnest money before on my blog, but today we are going to discuss it in the context of a hot market like the one we’re in right now.&nbsp;

In a normal market, your earnest money is deposited within a couple of days of mutual acceptance and you have a contingency or two that protect that money. If you walked away from the deal because of one of those contingencies, you get your money back. When you get to closing, the earnest money will go towards your cash to close.

Now let's put this in the context of a hot market like the one we have in the Greater Seattle Area. **People have to be aggressive with their offers if they want to get a house.** One of the factors of a really aggressive offer is nonrefundable earnest money. This means if you want to walk away from the deal, the seller keeps that money. If your broker knows what they are doing, you will have a clause in there that covers you in case of a seller default. I’m sure some of you are already cringing even thinking about having nonrefundable earnest money, but you have to understand that it is a calculated risk.

If you have listened to my blog for any length of time, you have heard me talk about calculated risk. Now let's talk about it in the context of nonrefundable earnest money. Earnest money goes toward your purchase price when you close. If everything goes to plan and you close on the house, the nonrefundable earnest money still goes toward the purchase of the property. So your risk is if something goes wrong and you don’t close on the house.&nbsp;

How do you minimize the risk? First, be OK with any of the issues the house has. Few houses are perfect, so more than likely you will want to do a pre-inspection which I discussed in my last video. The inspection isn’t pass/fail, it’s meant to find out what the issues are and decide if you can live with them.

If you are getting financing, be sure you are confident that the appraisal is going to come in at the value you need it to. If it won’t, you’ll need to cover the difference between the appraised value and the agreed-upon contract price if needed. This is a whole topic in itself and I will have another video on this soon.

**Now before you go making nonrefundable earnest money offers, you will want to know if the earnest money funds are being released to the seller and what risks come with that**.

Earlier I mentioned the term “calculated risk." Offering nonrefundable earnest money, releasing it to the seller, and not having verbiage for a seller default isn’t just risky, it is FOOLISH\!

Deciding whether to make your earnest money nonrefundable isn’t easy, and there may be more potential issues to discuss for your particular situation. I always advise talking with an attorney in regards to nonrefundable earnest money. If we work together, this will definitely be discussed during our consultation. Even if you aren’t up against it now in multiple offers, if you are willing to take the “calculated risk," it could be the secret weapon you have been looking for to get your offer accepted\!

If you have any other real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
