My guest today, Alex Mont-Ros, has an extensive background in sales, corporate leadership, and management. In 2003, Alex started his career as a successful real estate broker selling and listing both residential and commercial properties. Later, he transitioned careers to corporate management as a regional leader for a Fortune 15 company managing over $100 million in revenues for global retailers and firms. As co-founder of Moncord Real Estate Professional Services, Alex is tasked with developing Moncord’s strategic and marketing initiatives.&nbsp;
