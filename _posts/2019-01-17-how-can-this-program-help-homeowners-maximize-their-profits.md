<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re thinking about selling your home, we’ve got an exciting program to talk to you about today. The best part about it is that there’s no risk or cost involved on your part.</em></p>

Today I’m excited to talk to you about a cool new way to maximize the profit of your home sale. It’s actually a program we have at our company where we front the costs for you to make repairs and improvements in your home in order to get it sold for the most amount of money. **This comes with no risk and no cost to you as a homeowner.**

The first step is to have us come over to the house and determine what upgrades and improvements need to be made in order to maximize your profit. The next step is getting you accepted into our program. Then we get the work done with our contractors and pay them ourselves.

**Once your home is sold by our company, we are reimbursed through the profits you have made through the sale of your home at no extra cost.** You can see that you have no risk, no additional costs, and a home that’s primed and ready to sell for a maximized price, which helps you win as a homeowner.

If you have any questions about this program or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
