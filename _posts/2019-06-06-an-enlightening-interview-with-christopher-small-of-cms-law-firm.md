<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I brought in Christopher Small, owner of CMS Law Firm, to discuss the formation, purpose, and philosophy of his firm, and to hear about the wisdom he’s gained in the process. You won’t want to miss this.</em></p>

Christopher Small originally started CMS Law Firm back in 2009 as a criminal offense and personal injury attorney. Over time, he morphed the firm’s purpose and ultimately restarted in 2016 as an estate planning firm.

The reason for the change was that, frankly, he got burned out doing the other stuff. Once Chris had children of his own, the concepts of legacy and protecting his family became very real and he found that not only he was inherently interested in them, but they were valuable to him and other people. After making the change, 99% of the people who came into his office did so in a good place, and they also left in a good place—that doesn’t happen a lot in other areas of law.

Today I brought Chris in to discuss the formation, purpose, and philosophy of CMS Law Firm, and to hear about the wisdom he’s gained in the process.
