Well, in King County, the average sales price decreased by 3.1%, and Seattle dropped by 2.9%.For King County, we have 2.5 months of supply, which is 2.5% more than we had last year. Seattle has 2.1 months of supply, but they’re up almost 300% from last year!“We won’t know exactly how much of a frenzy to expect until we see what happens in March, April, and May.”We all remember what was going on last year, with the multiple offers right and left and crazy frenzies. As fast as homes were selling then, the more inventory we have this year, the less we’ll see that sort of frenzied market. But we won’t know exactly how much of a frenzy to expect until we see what happens in March, April, and May—that will determine the level of inventory and how quickly things sell.Like I always say: There are a lot of steps to buying and selling a home in today’s market.

It’s still a great time to be a seller, though, and here’s why.As we take a look at our King County market through October, we’re seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos. We’re also seeing prices continue to appreciate at a rate of 6% to 6.5%.The big news here is the increase in inventory. For residential homes, inventory has increased 86% year over year. For condos, it has increased 188% year over year.If you’re a buyer, this means you have more homes to choose from and you’ll be facing less competition. If you enter the market now, you’ll also get a better interest rate than you would if you waited several months down the road. Since the Federal Reserve is planning on raising rates even more than they already have, they have nowhere to go but up.If you’re a seller, the good news is you don’t have to worry about the bottom dropping out due to this rise in inventory. Why? Prices are still going up. Though they’re not spiking by double digits anymore, they’re still appreciating.“We’re seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos.”If you’re looking to buy an investment property, make sure you know your numbers and you have a good idea of what your property’s value will be in the future, because the market won’t bail you out the way it would have in the past if you make a bad purchase.No matter what your real estate goals are, it’s most important to have an experienced real estate professional by your side so they can guide you through the process.

Here are three benefits of selling in the fall and winter.Many people think that the spring and summer are the only times that you can benefit from selling a home. That’s absolutely not true. Here are three reasons to sell your Seattle home this fall or winter:1. Less inventory. More inventory means more competition, so listing in the fall and winter while there is less competition means that you’re more likely to sell.2. Motivated buyers. During this time of year, buyers are motivated. Maybe they want to move by the holidays or maybe they have a new job starting in January and want to get settled. Whatever the reason, buyers are more motivated in general during this time of year.3. Marketing. The Greater Puget Sound area is so gorgeous during the autumn and winter, and listing during this time is a great way to show off your home in the best light possible.“Buyers are especially motivated during this time of year.”There are a lot of things to know and a lot of steps to take when you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in a shifting market. The one thing that you need to remember is to give me a call or send me an email so I can help guide you through these steps. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "With all the hype about the article in the Seattle Times that mentioned dropping home prices and rising inventory, I want to update you on what’s actually going on in the market.There’s been a lot of buzz about the Seattle Times article saying that the median home price in Seattle has dropped by $70,000 in the last three months, and that there was 66% more inventory in the market.Today I’d like to address these statistics for everyone in the market.If you’re a seller, you’re likely seeing that there are more price reductions and more inventory in the market. Because of that, homes are taking just a little bit longer to sell. The fact of the matter is that homes that are positioned properly when they first come on the market are selling with multiple offers, sometimes even above asking price.If you’re a buyer, you’ll also have noticed the increase in inventory, which means more options for you to choose from. You probably won’t see as many crazy multiple offer situations that you have earlier this year. Sellers are also more willing to accept contingent offers. You’ll also notice the surge in price reductions, which means you won’t have to rush to a given house and spend a lot of money on pre-inspections before you can get it.Renters, like buyers and sellers, will enjoy the upswing of inventory as well. You might see big apartment complexes offering incentives to renters, so it’s a good time to take advantage.“Even though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year.”We’re also noticing more and more investors jumping back in the market, especially in the realm of single-family homes. There are some developers continuing to build; some were hesitant about the market, but the savvy ones are still in the game, looking for deals.Even with all this information, home prices are still up 2.9% over last year. Even though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year. This is a healthy adjustment; we’re still below two months of supply in most areas, meaning it’s a seller’s market.In our changing market, there are many steps to buying and selling a home. The first one you should take is to give me a call so I can help guide advise you through the rest of the steps. For any other questions, feel free to reach out to me.",

This is good news for buyer and sellers.As we make our way through June, what does our Seattle market look like for buyers and sellers?As I’ve been saying the past couple of months, inventory is increasing and pending sales are slowing down ever so slightly. Last month in King County, the number of active listings increased by 35%. As a whole, the Northwest MLS has not seen this kind of spike in new listings since May 2008. During the same time, the number of pending sales decreased 2.5%.With the increase in inventory we’re seeing, buyers have the opportunity to get the home they want without dealing with the frenzy they previously had to deal with.“Inventory is increasing and pending sales are slowing down ever so slightly.”What about sellers, though? Despite the increase in inventory and the slight dip in pending sales, the median home price is still 14% higher than it was at this time last year. We’re seeing great appreciation, but if you are a seller, you still need to make sure you work with an agent who has the knowledge to advise you in our shifting market.As I always say, there are a lot of things you need to know to navigate a shifting market like ours, but the one thing you need to remember is to give me a call so I can advise you through the rest of the steps.If you have any other questions about our current market or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Whatever your increase is, you need to budget for it moving forward.If you are a homebuyer, be careful about the property taxes you are being quoted for any home you are interested in. You do not want the shock of moving into a house thinking you will have to make a certain payment next year only to have that payment increase, which will also increase your monthly mortgage payment.“Property taxes in our area are about to go up.”As always, there are many steps to buying or selling a home, but the one step you need to remember is to give me a call.

In the months prior to our recent stretch, we saw inventory levels undergo a double-digit drop.Sales, however, are down about 2%. Even though we’re absorbing a lot of the inventory coming onto the market, we haven’t seen the same double-digit increase in pending sales that we did in the previous months where inventory dropped by double digits.“Downward pressure on prices means both buyers and sellers get a little more breathing room.”If this trend continues, we’ll soon see downward pressure on prices. This doesn’t mean they’ll plummet or that a recession is on the horizon; it just means everyone gets a little more breathing room. Sellers will have more time to sell their homes.

There was another segment on KING 5 News that said if your Seattle home had a day job, it would be making $54.24 an hour. Isn’t that amazing?Here are some numbers for King County. The median sale price is now up to $689,950 for single-family homes. That’s an increase of 15% in just the last year!“Homes are continuing to appreciate at an astonishing rate.”Another interesting fact that came out was that we have seen quite a boost in inventory. With the spring and summer months, that’s to be expected. However, our inventory is about 1% less than it was at this time last year, with about 1% more sales in the same time period. If this trend continues, we could see downward pressure on prices.

Here’s the next step you should take.Look, as fast as this market is moving, you need to have a competitive edge.

Here’s how you can get it.There’s still another step that people have to take beyond a pre-approval in order to be fully approved to buy a home. We have been recommending our clients to get pre-underwritten. This means you submit the same documentation as you do for a pre-approval, then you submit it to the underwriter, who goes through it with a fine-toothed comb. This gives the seller one less hurdle to worry about after they get under contract.“We have more than 30 strategies to utilize, depending on your situation.”We have more than 30 strategies to utilize, depending on your situation.
