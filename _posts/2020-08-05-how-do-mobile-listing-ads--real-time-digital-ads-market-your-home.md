<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I’ll discuss two helpful virtual agent services: mobile listing ads and real-time digital ads.</em></p>

There are two virtual agent services that can help you gain much more attention for your listing: mobile listing ads and real-time digital ads.

**With mobile listing ads, we can geofence an area such that when someone enters the area, they will see the listing ad.** For example, with this technology, if someone drives into West Seattle while using the Waze app, the mobile ad will pop up on the app. When they click on the listing, they will be able to get all the information that they normally would. The cool part is that even though they may not be able to grab a flyer or write down the MLS number, the next time they hop on their desktop computer, that ad will pop there, as well. The point of this is to retarget them to determine just how interested in the listing they are.

**Now, with Compass’s real-time digital ad tool, we’re able to quickly and easily launch a highly targeted and optimized digital campaign on Facebook and Instagram.** More than that, we’ll also be able to get real-time, detailed results so that we can react swiftly to what our marketing and digital ads are telling us about who the buyer demographic is. That will give the ability to target buyers more directly and hopefully sell your house faster and for a higher price.

Both of these marketing options can boost the exposure for your listing, which is critical for you to get top dollar or to even set the new record sales price for your area.
