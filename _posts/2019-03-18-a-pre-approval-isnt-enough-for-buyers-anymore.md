Look, as fast as this market is moving, you need to have a competitive edge. There are multiple offer situations all over the place, and you want your offer to give you that competitive edge against other buyers. **Here’s how you can get it.**

There’s still another step that people have to take beyond a pre-approval in order to be fully approved to buy a home. We have been recommending our clients to get pre-underwritten. This means you submit the same documentation as you do for a pre-approval, then you submit it to the underwriter, who goes through it with a fine-toothed comb. **This gives the seller one less hurdle to worry about after they get under contract.**
