Our market is like buying toilet paper during the pandemic—in a frenzy.

The real estate market is like toilet paper. Why? Think back to the start of the pandemic when trying to get toilet paper caused a frenzy. That’s what real estate is like in a low inventory, low interest market.&nbsp;

Instead of homes being completely out of stock, for real estate buyers, it means getting beaten out on multiple offers, spending money on pre-inspections but not getting the house, or you simply can’t find “the one.” **Some of you are like the store stocking toilet paper; you not only have to buy, you also have to sell.** However, unlike the store, you can’t just sell out of the product. When you sell your home, you need to have somewhere to go, or you could find yourself with an empty toilet paper roll… out of luck.

This could mean multiple moves, moving in with in-laws or friends, renting a house (which can be hard to find and require a lengthy lease), or moving into a vacation rental (which can be pricey). All of these are solutions, but they’re not ideal because you still need to eventually buy a home, and **you’ll be competing in a frenzied market.&nbsp;**

As you may have guessed, the owner of the store is likely not out of toilet paper in his own house. Like the store owner, you need an advantage to get the property you want with no bidding wars, wasted money, or heartbreak. Luckily for you, I have the answer.&nbsp;

The silent seller solution helps you find a home before it comes onto the market. Not only will you find the house before anyone knows it’s for sale, but the entire process is also less stressful and less expensive. **To learn more about this great silent seller solution, visit my website today.**
