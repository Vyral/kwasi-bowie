In today’s edition of “Hot Topics in Hot Markets,” we’re discussing pricing, the dangers of overpricing, and how it’s kind of like dating. We all know that **the real estate market is currently incredibly hot**; houses are selling very quickly. However, when they don’t sell quickly, people wonder what’s wrong with them.&nbsp;

I think it’s a lot like dating; you see someone who’s attractive, but they’ve been on the market for a date for a long time, and you start thinking about what might be wrong with them. You may think something’s wrong with them mentally or they’ll be extremely unreasonable. However, with both dating and real estate, there could be nothing wrong.&nbsp;

In real estate, it could just be that **the house was overpriced, but now there’s a negative perception that has to be overcome before a sale can move forward.** That will be reflected in the price and terms you get in the offers submitted for your home. So ahead of time, you need to properly prepare your home for sale. Don’t be lazy and just think that the market’s going to give you the price you need. Make the needed repairs and make any upgrades possible.&nbsp;

You want to make sure buyers have no doubts about the house’s condition and price, so focus on pending prices for your comps. Look at what other houses went under contract for and what their listing prices were. Even if it’s a sold comp, look at the listing price before they accepted an offer, the days on market, and if it sold for over asking price. Once you have that data, look at the trends, and make some strategic decisions.&nbsp;
