Today I’ve got a hot-off-the-press market update for you for June 2019. We’re going to do something a little different this time by giving you the latest numbers from King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties.

**Starting at the 0:55 mark in the video above, you can skip around to your specific county and peruse those statistics.**

Pierce County - 0:58

Snohomish County - 1:38

Seattle and Eastside - 2:20

If you'd like additional stats for your specific city or neighborhood, reach out to me today and I’d be more than happy to send them over.&nbsp;
