In order for a home to sell quickly and for top dollar, there are some things that must be done to prepare. However, homeowners often underestimate the amount they’ll have to spend to get their property ready for sale. Today we’ll talk about the costs you’ll have when preparing your home to sell for its highest price possible. **You’ll be paying for:**

* Cosmetic Repairs
* Interior paint
* Carpet cleaning
* Refinishing hardwood floors
* Landscaping

After looking at the cost of the items involved, many homeowners decide to refrain from selling as they can’t afford these finishing touches.
