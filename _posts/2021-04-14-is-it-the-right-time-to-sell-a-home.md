Is now a good time to sell a home in the Seattle real estate market? **The answer is yes and no.** Here's what I mean.

**The answer is yes if you want top dollar for your house.** The answer is also yes if you want as few contingencies as possible in an offer and the easiest sale possible.

**The only time I would say the answer is no is if you have too many question marks** about how you’re going to buy your next house. A lot of people have been asking me, “How do I buy a house if I need to sell first?” Contingent offers are not winning in this market, so homebuyers are looking for solutions.

Compass has a bridge loan program that covers up to six months of your new home’s payments. This will allow you to be a non-contingent buyer of your new home without having to sell first.

If you’re thinking about buying, selling, or want to learn more about the Compass bridge loan program, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
