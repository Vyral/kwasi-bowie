I found these [hilarious real estate photos](http://boredomtherapy.com/terrible-real-estate-agent-photos/){: target="_blank"}, and they’re so funny that I wanted you to see them too. They’re not only a great laugh, but these pictures can also show you what not to do when trying to get your home sold.

Keep an eye out for real estate red flags, such as:

* **Using a cell phone for photos.** Most buyers see photos before ever setting foot in your home. You want to make the best first impression with professional photography.
* **Not using a stager to make your home more appealing.** Homes that are staged and have professional photography sell for more money in less time.
