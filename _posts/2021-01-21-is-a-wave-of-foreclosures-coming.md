<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are three reasons we likely won’t see a wave of foreclosures soon.</em></p>

Is a foreclosure wave coming? Given the massive increase in unemployment this past year, it’s reasonable to assume there’s a colossal surge of foreclosures forthcoming, just like in 2008. However, history is not expected to repeat itself this time. I recently read [an article](https://www.keepingcurrentmatters.com/article/3-graphs-that-prove-were-not-headed-for-a-foreclosure-crisis/)that succinctly describes why not, and I wanted to share some of that information with you.&nbsp;

Here are three reasons a foreclosure crisis isn’t likely to hit Seattle:

**1\. Equity.** Today’s homeowners have an abundance of equity. Right before the 2008 housing crash, people put little to no money down, or they did big cash-out refinances to go on lavish vacations or buy extravagant toys that left them with no equity. Then, when they couldn’t make payments and needed to sell their house, they owed more than the house was worth.**&nbsp;**

**2\. Forbearance.** According to Black Knight, of the over 5.7 million people who applied for forbearance, 44% opted out, and only 80,000 of them are at risk of foreclosure. Also, 91% of the people in forbearance have at least 11% equity.

**3\. Lenders are offering help.** Lenders are assisting people with making deferred payment plans. Back in 2008, lenders didn’t have any options for homeowners in default; some banks were even telling people to stop making payments in order to give them options. Today there are multiple options for homeowners to pursue. With the right planning and communication with their lender, homeowners may be able to avoid foreclosure, especially if they have equity in their homes.&nbsp;

I can’t predict the future, and another curveball could come. All we can do is look at the facts and trends, and make an educated decision. Most people don’t buy a home because of what the real estate market is doing; they buy or sell based on their situation.&nbsp;

If you’re considering buying or selling in the next year to 18 months, let’s chat. **No sales pitch, no obligation**, just a real conversation. Also, if you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
