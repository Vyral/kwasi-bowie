Virtual open houses and tours can show your home to anyone.

Have you seen a virtual open house? **At 0:30 in the video above, you can see a virtual 3D Matterport video.** I made this video years ago and talked about how it would be a game-changer, and here we are during a health crisis, and that is more true than ever.

Since I’ve been doing virtual tours for years, I know the best practices and what people want to see. These help you walk through the home as if you’re physically there. Years ago we graduated from flip camera tours to high production videos and 3D tours. What’s right for your house; video or 3D tours?&nbsp;

Give me a call or send an email and I’ll guide you through the best way to use a virtual open house on your listing. Also, please contact me if you have any questions about real estate. I would love to speak with you.
