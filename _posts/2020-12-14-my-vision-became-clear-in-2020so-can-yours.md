<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Despite everything that’s happened in 2020, I’m grateful.</em></p>

Today I want to wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.&nbsp;

What a year 2020 has been\! I remember at the end of 2019 that many experts in the personal development world were designating 2020 as the year of perfect vision, and accomplishing the goals for your perfect vision. Nobody saw the pandemic coming, but 2020 can still be the year of perfect vision.

The way I look at it, my vision did become clear. **I’m clear on what I’m grateful for: my family, friends, career, and health.** While my family wasn’t able to uphold the usual Thanksgiving traditions and won’t be able to for Christmas either, I’ve come to cherish the moments we’ve had even more. When we gather for the holidays next year, God willing, it will be even more special.&nbsp;

I hope this message finds you well, helps you think about what you’re grateful for, and helps you envision a better 2021. If you’re ever in need of real estate assistance or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you. Happy holidays\!
