        <title>The Latest from Our Local Real Estate Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jUcOfPNlMXk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s your February real estate market update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In King County, we’ve seen an increase in the number of homes for sale by 123%. Now, in Seattle, we’ve seen an increase of 131%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the average sales price? Well, in King County, the average sales price decreased by 3.1%, and Seattle dropped by 2.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For King County, we have 2.5 months of supply, which is 2.5% more than we had last year. Seattle has 2.1 months of supply, &lt;strong&gt;but they’re up almost 300% from last year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We won’t know exactly how much of a frenzy to expect until we see what happens in March, April, and May.%20http://localhost:4000/the-latest-from-our-local-real-estate-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We won’t know exactly how much of a frenzy to expect until we see what happens in March, April, and May.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all remember what was going on last year, with the multiple offers right and left and crazy frenzies. &lt;strong&gt;As fast as homes were selling then, the more inventory we have this year, the less we’ll see that sort of frenzied market.&lt;/strong&gt; But we won’t know exactly how much of a frenzy to expect until we see what happens in March, April, and May—that will determine the level of inventory and how quickly things sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I always say: There are a lot of steps to buying and selling a home in today’s market. The one step you need to remember is to give me a call, and I’ll help guide and advise you through the rest of the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can This Program Help Homeowners Maximize Their Profits?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZf8iSORnYc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re thinking about selling your home, we’ve got an exciting program to talk to you about today. The best part about it is that there’s no risk or cost involved on your part.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m excited to talk to you about a cool new way to maximize the profit of your home sale. It’s actually a program we have at our company where we front the costs for you to make repairs and improvements in your home in order to get it sold for the most amount of money. &lt;strong&gt;This comes with no risk and no cost to you as a homeowner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to have us come over to the house and determine what upgrades and improvements need to be made in order to maximize your profit. The next step is getting you accepted into our program. Then we get the work done with our contractors and pay them ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’ll get the work scheduled and paid for.%20http://localhost:4000/how-can-this-program-help-homeowners-maximize-their-profits.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’ll get the work scheduled and paid for.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once your home is sold by our company, we are reimbursed through the profits you have made through the sale of your home at no extra cost.&lt;/strong&gt; You can see that you have no risk, no additional costs, and a home that’s primed and ready to sell for a maximized price, which helps you win as a homeowner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this program or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cost of Preparing a Home for Sale and How We’ll Help You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzeV0ZsRFcc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preparing a home for sale costs money that sellers may not have, which is why we’re offering to help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a home to sell quickly and for top dollar, there are some things that must be done to prepare. However, homeowners often underestimate the amount they’ll have to spend to get their property ready for sale. Today we’ll talk about the costs you’ll have when preparing your home to sell for its highest price possible. &lt;strong&gt;You’ll be paying for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cosmetic Repairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interior paint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carpet cleaning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refinishing hardwood floors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Landscaping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the cost of the items involved, many homeowners decide to refrain from selling as they can’t afford these finishing touches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Homeowners often underestimate the amount they’ll have to spend to get their property ready for sale.%20http://localhost:4000/the-cost-of-preparing-a-home-for-sale-and-how-well-help-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Homeowners often underestimate the amount they’ll have to spend to get their property ready for sale.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, you’re in luck. &lt;strong&gt;We’re offering to front the cost of preparing your home for sale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking of selling anytime in the near future, reach out to us as soon as possible. It sometimes takes time to coordinate a preparation plan with our sellers, &lt;strong&gt;so let us know as soon as you can so we can begin preparing your home for sale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to learn more and see how we can help you, give us a call at &lt;strong&gt;206-802-2710.&lt;/strong&gt; We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s the Latest News From Our King County Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iOnPaDLvpA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inventory is increasing in our market, which is good news for buyers. It’s still a great time to be a seller, though, and here’s why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we take a look at our King County market through October, &lt;strong&gt;we’re seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re also seeing prices continue to appreciate at a rate of 6% to 6.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big news here is the increase in inventory. For residential homes, inventory has increased 86% year over year. For condos, it has increased 188% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a buyer, this means you have more homes to choose from and you’ll be facing less competition.&lt;/strong&gt; If you enter the market now, you’ll also get a better interest rate than you would if you waited several months down the road. Since the Federal Reserve is planning on raising rates even more than they already have, they have nowhere to go but up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re a seller, the good news is you don’t have to worry about the bottom dropping out due to this rise in inventory.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? Prices are still going up. Though they’re not spiking by double digits anymore, they’re still appreciating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We’re seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-the-latest-news-from-our-king-county-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’re seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy an investment property, make sure you know your numbers and you have a good idea of what your property’s value will be in the future, because the market won’t bail you out the way it would have in the past if you make a bad purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what your real estate goals are, it’s most important to have an experienced real estate professional by your side so they can guide you through the process. If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Your Home on the List? 26 Hilarious Real Estate Photos</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/osUVVQFyO7c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;These real estate photos are hilarious, but also show us some pitfalls to avoid. See what to look out for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found these &lt;a href=&quot;http://boredomtherapy.com/terrible-real-estate-agent-photos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hilarious real estate photos&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re so funny that I wanted you to see them too. They’re not only a great laugh, but these pictures can also show you what not to do when trying to get your home sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for real estate red flags, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a cell phone for photos.&lt;/strong&gt; Most buyers see photos before ever setting foot in your home. You want to make the best first impression with professional photography.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using a stager to make your home more appealing.&lt;/strong&gt; Homes that are staged and have professional photography sell for more money in less time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When you’re dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars, you need to take it seriously.%20http://localhost:4000/is-your-home-on-the-list-26-hilarious-real-estate-photos.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When you’re dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars, you need to take it seriously.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid pitfalls such as these (and avoid starring in our next episode), give us a call and we can help you. Whether you want to buy a home, sell a home, ask us questions, or want real estate information and advice, we are here to give you a hand. When you’re dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars, you need to take it seriously. &lt;strong&gt;The first step is giving us a call.&lt;/strong&gt; We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Should You Consider Selling This Fall or Winter?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MU1b-rdoQw8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring and summer aren’t the only times you can find success in the home-selling world. Here are three benefits of selling in the fall and winter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people think that the spring and summer are the only times that you can benefit from selling a home. That’s absolutely not true. &lt;strong&gt;Here are three reasons to sell your Seattle home this fall or winter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Less inventory.&lt;/strong&gt; More inventory means more competition, so listing in the fall and winter while there is less competition means that you’re more likely to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Motivated buyers.&lt;/strong&gt; During this time of year, buyers are motivated. Maybe they want to move by the holidays or maybe they have a new job starting in January and want to get settled. Whatever the reason, buyers are more motivated in general during this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Marketing.&lt;/strong&gt; The Greater Puget Sound area is so gorgeous during the autumn and winter, and listing during this time is a great way to show off your home in the best light possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Buyers are especially motivated during this time of year.%20http://localhost:4000/why-should-you-consider-selling-this-fall-or-winter.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Buyers are especially motivated during this time of year.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things to know and a lot of steps to take when you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in a shifting market. The one thing that you need to remember is to give me a call or send me an email so I can help guide you through these steps. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>September 2018 Seattle Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANC259cOaHM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;With all the hype about the article in the Seattle Times that mentioned dropping home prices and rising inventory, I want to update you on what’s actually going on in the market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of buzz about the Seattle Times article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/seattle-home-prices-drop-by-70000-in-three-months-as-market-cooldown-continues/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that the median home price in Seattle has dropped by $70,000 in the last three months, and that there was 66% more inventory in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to address these statistics for everyone in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller, you’re likely seeing that there are more price reductions and more inventory in the market. Because of that, &lt;strong&gt;homes are taking just a little bit longer to sell.&lt;/strong&gt; The fact of the matter is that homes that are positioned properly when they first come on the market are selling with multiple offers, sometimes even above asking price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer, you’ll also have noticed the increase in inventory, which means more options for you to choose from. You probably won’t see as many crazy multiple offer situations that you have earlier this year. &lt;strong&gt;Sellers are also more willing to accept contingent offers.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll also notice the surge in price reductions, which means you won’t have to rush to a given house and spend a lot of money on pre-inspections before you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renters, like buyers and sellers, will enjoy the upswing of inventory as well. You might see big apartment complexes offering incentives to renters, &lt;strong&gt;so it’s a good time to take advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Even though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year.%20http://localhost:4000/september-2018-seattle-market-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Even though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also noticing more and more investors jumping back in the market, especially in the realm of single-family homes. There are some developers continuing to build; some were hesitant about the market, but the savvy ones are still in the game, looking for deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all this information, &lt;strong&gt;home prices are still up 2.9% over last year.&lt;/strong&gt; Even though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year. This is a healthy adjustment; we’re still below two months of supply in most areas, meaning it’s a seller’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our changing market, there are many steps to buying and selling a home. The first one you should take is to give me a call so I can help guide advise you through the rest of the steps. For any other questions, feel free to reach out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>News From Our Market Is Coming Soon, But I've Got Another Important Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTjDJT6pYNI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;After taking some time off, I’m back today to announce the reason for my absence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I haven’t updated you all on the market in a while, but there’s a very good reason why I’ve been gone. &lt;strong&gt;On July 17, my wife and I were blessed with two beautiful twins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kash Lawrence came into the world at 4:31 p.m. that Tuesday evening at 6 pounds 7.8 ounces and 17 ¾ inches, and his sister London Jane joined him soon after at 4:40 p.m., measuring at 6 pounds 9.6 ounces and 19 inches long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two hold such a special place in our hearts, along with our eldest son Asher—who has proven to be an amazing older brother already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with three kids under three years old, I’m sure you can see what’s been keeping me away from making videos. On top of spending time with my recently expanded family, though, I have still been helping clients like you navigate today’s changing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I truly couldn’t be happier with my amazing family, my amazing team, and my amazing clients.%20http://localhost:4000/news-from-our-market-is-coming-soon-but-ive-got-another-important-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I truly couldn’t be happier with my amazing family, my amazing team, and my amazing clients.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that my wife and I have begun to adjust to this major change in our lives, I’ll be getting back to you with another update soon.&lt;/strong&gt; So be on the lookout for my next market update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly couldn’t be happier with my amazing family, my amazing team, and my amazing clients, and I’m excited to get back to bringing you the latest real estate news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
