I know I haven’t updated you all on the market in a while, but there’s a very good reason why I’ve been gone. **On July 17, my wife and I were blessed with two beautiful twins.**

Kash Lawrence came into the world at 4:31 p.m. that Tuesday evening at 6 pounds 7.8 ounces and 17 ¾ inches, and his sister London Jane joined him soon after at 4:40 p.m., measuring at 6 pounds 9.6 ounces and 19 inches long.

These two hold such a special place in our hearts, along with our eldest son Asher—who has proven to be an amazing older brother already.

So, with three kids under three years old, I’m sure you can see what’s been keeping me away from making videos. On top of spending time with my recently expanded family, though, I have still been helping clients like you navigate today’s changing market.

**Now that my wife and I have begun to adjust to this major change in our lives, I’ll be getting back to you with another update soon.** So be on the lookout for my next market update.

I truly couldn’t be happier with my amazing family, my amazing team, and my amazing clients, and I’m excited to get back to bringing you the latest real estate news.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
