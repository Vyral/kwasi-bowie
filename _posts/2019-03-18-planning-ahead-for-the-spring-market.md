<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, the stats from this market update are important to know.</em></p>

I’m back with your March 2018 market update, and I have some important stats to share, whether you’re a buyer or a seller.

Heading into the spring market, a lot of buyers are thinking there will be more inventory and less competition. Sellers are thinking that this is the time to put their homes on the market.

If you take a look at the end of February, there were a little over 1,900 homes that came onto the market. In January, there were about 2,300 homes that appeared on the market. As we approach spring, we’re actually seeing less inventory.

What does that mean for you?

**If you’re a buyer, it means that there won’t be as much inventory as you might expect. For sellers, you’ll have to think about if you want to sell in a market where there’s less inventory**

If you want to know the specifics of your area, feel free to reach out to me. We can have a discussion and figure out a plan for you how should move forward in the market.
