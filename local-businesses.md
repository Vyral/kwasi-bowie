<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Turnkey Vacation Rentals is changing the way home renters and homeowners operate. Sarah Carter joined me recently to explain how.</em></p>

I had the pleasure of recently being joined by Sarah Carter of Turnkey Vacation Rentals. We talked about her business, how they are working to enhance the real estate experience for renters and property owners, and much more. <strong>Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you most:</strong>

0:10- How did Turnkey get started and what problems were they trying to solve?
1:40- What exactly does Turnkey do?
6:00- How Turnkey ensures that their renters always have a great stay
8:40- Why having great guest reviews is so important to Turnkey
9:30- Who are Turnkey’s ideal customers?
10:40- The No. 1 question Sarah hears from potential clients and customers
15:30- How is Turnkey handling Seattle’s recent restrictions on short-term rentals?
18:15- What is the big problem that Turnkey’s customers run into and how does Sarah advise them on solving it?

<strong>Turnkey is actually making a few special offers for a few select groups of people out there.</strong> For Realtors and Brokers, for every homeowner that they refer to Turnkey that signs up, they will get a referral bonus of $1,500. This bonus is unlimited.

For homeowners, if you sign a contract with Turnkey, they will offer a complimentary deep clean of your property. Make sure you mention that you heard the offer through my blog!

Thanks so much to Sarah for joining me. If you have any questions for her about Turnkey, what they do, or how they can help you, reach out to her at (888) 512-0498 or visit their website <a href="https://www.turnkeyvr.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
