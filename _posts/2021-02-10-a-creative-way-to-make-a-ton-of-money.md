Here’s a simple way to make a bunch of money in real estate right now.

Today I’m sharing a creative, simple way to make a ton of money when you buy a certain type of house in Seattle. In 2019, Seattle went through a big zoning change where some properties went from single-family to multifamily zoning. **Now you can build multiple homes where before you could only build one.** Of course, this has been happening for years, but the zoning changes meant more properties have this multifamily zoning.&nbsp;

If a builder were to purchase this type of property, they’d want 12 to 18 months to close because they want to go through the entire permitting process before they close on the house. That’s a long time for a seller to wait to get their money. So the opportunity for the average buyer is to **purchase one of these properties at market value and sell the additional lots** once you subdivide it. You have this opportunity because a traditional loan can close in 30 to 45 days, so the seller gets their money much quicker, which is much more appealing to them.

As an example, let’s say you bought a property for $700,000 in West Seattle that had LR1 zoning. Let’s also say that you could get two lots behind it because of this zoning. Once you’ve subdivided those lots, you could make $150,000 to $200,000 for selling those two lots. For most people, having that much extra money changes your life\!&nbsp;

I want to be very clear about one thing: These are not tear-down houses. **These are average homes that got rezoned, and now there’s a gold mine sitting in their backyards.**

Some of you may be a bit savvy about this and are wondering how you can sell off the back lots if you have a loan on it. That’s the secret sauce you have to call me for; I sold my neighbor’s lots to a builder, and they had a loan on their house. It’s a simple process, but you need to have the right team get it done for you.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer who may be interested in this or a seller who got upzoned and want to sell off your back lots (or your entire house), let’s talk. There’s no sales pitch or obligation, just a real conversation.
