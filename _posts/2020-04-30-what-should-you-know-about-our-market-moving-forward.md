Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our market is still moving. Here’s what this means for buyers, sellers, renters, and investors.

What’s the state of our Greater Seattle area market amid the COVID-19 pandemic?

I recently released some market statistics from King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, but I know that there’s a lot of concern out there that we’re headed for another housing crisis. The good news is, the previous housing crisis was different than the situation we face now.

Before the pandemic hit, we had a strong local real estate market and national stock market. Everything that’s happened since has only delayed the growth we were experiencing. When you look at the stats, inventory is still lower than it was at this time last year and sale prices are still rising.

What does that mean moving forward? Nobody has a crystal ball to answer that question. Like I always say, the market varies depending on whether you’re a buyer, seller, renter, or investor.

<u><strong>If you&rsquo;re a buyer:</strong></u> As far as interest rates go, I have clients who are getting quoted as low as 2.75%. This changes daily, but it isn’t getting any cheaper to buy homes. If you’ve thought about buying a home, now is a great time to explore that option.

<u><strong>If you&rsquo;re a seller:</strong></u> As I said, inventory is still low, and prices are still rising. Tech workers are still working in our local economy, and we know that other industries will eventually be up and running again. We can tell by the numbers that the market is still moving, and we’re seeing multiple offers for listings, which means it could be a great time to sell.

**<u>If you&rsquo;re a renter:</u>** Just like housing demand will still be there at the end of the day, I expect demand for rentals to stay the same or become more competitive. This means landlords will get more competitive in terms of rent prices.

<u><strong>If you&rsquo;re an investor:</strong></u> It’s time to get back to the basics. You have to buy right and know your numbers. If you’re considering a deal but the numbers just don’t add up, send that deal over to me. I may know other investors or clients who are interested in that property.

If you have any questions about your specific situation or would like to know more about what’s happening in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.
