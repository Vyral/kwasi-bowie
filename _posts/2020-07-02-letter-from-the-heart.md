I’m writing to you as a friend with a heavy heart. The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor have sparked protests around the world\! While their deaths are tragic, there are so many others that we do not hear about. I have participated in these protests recently and in years past. I have supported the Black Lives Matter Movement from the beginning when Trayvon Martin was killed.&nbsp;

If you have questions about the movement, confused about why now, or don’t understand at all, now it is time to get educated and get involved. Even if you don’t agree with proposed solutions, I hope you can understand that it is a very dynamic problem and we all need to work together to solve the problem.&nbsp;

I'm honestly willing to sit down and have coffee or lunch with anybody who has the same or a different opinion on the Black Lives Matter Movement. <u>I&rsquo;m an adult and can have a conversation with someone with a different opinion.</u> I do NOT claim to have all of the answers or even any of the answers. What I can share is my experiences, stories of my family’s experiences, and explain the ***ACTUAL ISSUES***. They ARE NOT what you are probably hearing on ANY media outlet. Coffee or lunch is on me\! I truly believe these kinds of conversations are the only way that the division that has been created between people can be bridged. All the passive-aggressive comments and posts on Facebook won’t do SQUAT\!

Let me also be very clear, when I say Black Lives Matter, I am NOT saying only Black Lives Matter. I’m saying YES, All Lives Matter but right now, we have to need to have a conversation about BLACK LIVES\!

If you are reading this letter I realize that you may or may not have the same view as me. As a business owner, I realize that saying that I support the Black Lives Matter Movement could cost me business. If that is the way it is, then so be it\!&nbsp;

As messed up as that is, it’s the truth. I know that most likely it is because people are misinformed or uneducated about the actual issues. It doesn’t help when the media and politicians on both sides try and chime in and put their spin on it\! The systemic issues plaguing the Black and Brown communities are so much bigger than just Police Brutality. However, that is what gets the spotlight because that is what the media has decided is newsworthy. So some people think protestors are upset and outraged over a few incidents, when that just isn’t the case. Realize that while you are seeing the fire now, the embers have been extremely hot on these issues for a long time. Some outrage can come because so many people can relate to a specific incident because it is what happened to them.&nbsp;

I can tell you that when the story broke about Trayvon Martin it shook me to my core. My first encounter was very similar to his but mine was with actual police officers. Some friends and I had just gone to the store to pick up candy. While the 3 of us (all black) were walking to a friends house the cops pulled over on the side of the road right in front of us. From the time the police officer got out of his car he had his hand on his gun. They asked us for our IDs. We were only 12/13 years old so all we had were ASB cards.&nbsp;

When my friend asked why we were stopped the officer said we were walking too close to the white line on the road. While the one officer went back to the car to run our names the other one asked “what were we doing in this neighborhood”? We told him we were going to a friend’s house and had stopped to get candy at the store. When the officer came back with our IDs and told us we were “free to go” the other officer just said “Go Home” and finally took his hand off his gun.

This is just one instance of how my personal experience was close enough to what happened to Trayvon Martin that made me so upset. It makes me so mad because while so much in this world has changed, so many things have not changed.

I was inspired to write this letter to you because of a song called “My Life” by Pam Rose. I first heard the song when listening to an audiobook called <u>The One Thing</u> a few years back. I just happened to download and start listening to the book again. While this isn’t the normal music I listen to, the words struck me even harder this time around. Take a listen to the song [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Bw9kSlgJOcE){: target="_blank"} when you get a chance.

While listening to the song I realized to live the life I truly want, I have to be the change I’m looking for. I started thinking about how much time I have and where I want to spend that time. I thought about what really mattered to me. I don’t want to be remembered for how I die, I want to be remembered for how I live.

While I’m not going to fix all the problems with the system, I feel I can make a difference. There is so much we all have to give to this world. So many things to be grateful for. I’m fortunate enough to have found my place in the world and have had a lot of great mentors in my life. It's time for me to really start giving back. In order to do that I feel I’m going to have to make some changes. Because you are someone I care about, I want to share these changes with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Just like the old saying goes, if you want to clean up the neighborhood, start with your home first. I feel it starts with “Who I Am Being” at home with my wife and my kids. How do I show up for family get togethers? How engaged am I as a son, a brother, and an uncle?

Being an example for my kids is more important to me than ever. My son Asher is four years old and the twins, London and Kash, will be 2 years old soon. They are at an age where they will copy what I do. Do they see me being respectful to other people? Am I showing them the skills they need to succeed in this world? Most importantly, am I preparing them to handle the pressures and situations they may run into and how to deal with them?&nbsp;

To me, home also means my community. I have already reached out to a few of my friends who are directors or founders of non-profit organizations to see how I can volunteer. Sure, these places may need money to fund their projects but they also need people with a desire and a passion to make a difference. I want to be an example and a mentor to these kids.&nbsp;

Did you know that 1 out of 3 Black Men will go to jail in their lifetime? I almost did. Can I guide them through what I went through even though my close encounter isn’t an extreme example? My story isn’t anything overly dramatic, but it is my story. It is purely about my experience with racial profiling/racism, the image of who a black boy/man was in America, and struggling with where I fit in.

Being mixed Black and White. Dark enough that looking at me you aren’t going to say I’m white. However, because I am white being told that I’m not really black. It was a shock to me because it seemed like overnight I went from being just a kid, to a black kid who is a potential threat and the police and parents let me know it. Probably what hurt the most is while all this is happening parents of friends started accusing me of things or being vocal about not wanting me in the house for no other reason than I was the only black kid there. So what did I do? I threw my middle finger up to the world and said if this is who they think I am, then maybe that is who I am\!&nbsp;

So maybe my story won’t land with every kid. All I care about at this point is helping just one young man not be one of the 3. I overcame the hole I dug for myself. With a lot of support from my loving parents, friends that were close to me, a teacher who didn’t give up on me, and more than anything developing grit\! While I wouldn’t wish some of my experiences on anybody, I don’t have any regrets. Those experiences made me the person I am today. So, hopefully, for the kid who may not get that somewhere else, I can be that person for him.

I have not decided on a specific direction yet, but I know from the conversations I’ve had there are some places that need me and that I can have an impact. I know how real estate investments can not only change an individual's financial future but it can have a huge impact on a community. So why not pass this knowledge to these young men and women? Plant the seeds early. Teach them how to be business owners or even just how to be professional. Again, I have ideas but not sure where I can fit in- but I’m looking. If you have any suggestions or you would like to set up a fundraiser for your cause you believe in, please let me know.

I’m also going to be changing the way I run and operate my business. Most of the changes were already in the works. The COVID-19 pandemic gave me a lot of perspective on where I spend my time and what I make priority. However with recent events brought my vision full circle and gave me a “Jerry McGuire Moment.” Less Clients, More Service, More Impact (clients and community).

Moving to Compass a year and a half ago was a great move for me. I have been able to fuse together the efficiency systems that helped me grow my business, as well as learn the high end delivery to create luxury service and all price points.&nbsp;

By approaching my business this way I will be hyper-focused on the clients, their goals, and delivering a great experience. I am also pledging that **a percentage of the profit from every single closed sale will go to the causes that I personally volunteer for or that my clients choose.&nbsp;**

While the changes will benefit my clients more than EVER, I realize they may not work for everybody and that is okay. In order to have the impact on my family and in my community these changes are a non-negotiable. If it impacts business so be it\! Change can’t wait. The changes I’m making will also give me more time to be the husband, parent, son, brother, uncle, and friend. Enjoy more free time and vacations with those closest to me, THAT'S YOU\! All while bringing a joy, a confidence, to those I volunteer for and hope to inspire.&nbsp;

My goal is to prioritize my business around my life, my goals, and my aspirations of making an impact not vice-versa. No longer can my real priorities be an afterthought.

So I’m making a change. I’m changing my business. I’m changing where I spend my time. I’m changing where I spend my money. I’m making changes because if I can’t change how can I expect the rest of the world to change.&nbsp;

I’m done with just protesting. Wearing the shirt, chanting the slogans, but not getting involved. Then more dead brothers and sisters end up in the news and the cycle continues. Enough is Enough.

Look, I’m not a writer. I started writing to share a piece of what has been on my heart with people that I care about. So my grammar may not be right. I may have wandered with the direction of the letter. Some parts may be a declaration, some parts I may have tried to be thought provoking. Just know I put on paper my thoughts and feelings at the time. I just couldn’t be silent anymore. I can’t sit on the sidelines. Enough is Enough.

If you want resources or want to have a cup of coffee or lunch to talk about the issues whether you agree or disagree, please reach out to me. I would love to meet up.&nbsp;

Peace,

Kwasi
