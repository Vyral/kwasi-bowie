<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ve got a quick market update for you today. Here’s what’s going on in Seattle and King County.</em></p>

**Today I’ve got your April real estate market update for the Seattle area.** Let’s get right to it.

There was an article in the Seattle Times that said Seattle’s median home price is nearly $820,000 right now. There was another segment on KING 5 News that said if your Seattle home had a day job, it would be making $54.24 an hour. Isn’t that amazing?

Here are some numbers for King County. The median sale price is now up to $689,950 for single-family homes. That’s an increase of 15% in just the last year!

**Another interesting fact that came out was that we have seen quite a boost in inventory.** With the spring and summer months, that’s to be expected. However, our inventory is about 1% less than it was at this time last year, with about 1% more sales in the same time period. If this trend continues, we could see downward pressure on prices. However, nobody has a crystal ball so we aren’t certain.

If you’re thinking about getting your home on the market in the next few weeks, months, or years, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call. We would love to help. There are a lot of steps to buying or selling a home in today’s market, but the only one you have to remember is giving me a call. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
