<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These are just some of the virtual services that our team offers.</em></p>

There has been a lot of hype from real estate brokers talking about virtual agents, what they do to sell houses amid COVID-19, etc. The truth is that a lot of them are just starting to use these tools now, while our team has been using them for years.

If you’ve been following my blog, you’ve seen this. Now that there are new tools out there, however, **I want to bring those to your attention and let you know what they are and how we will use them to sell your home for maximum price.&nbsp;**

Our virtual services include:

* Virtual open houses
* Interactive home tours
* Virtual neighborhood tours
* Dynamic digital brochures
* Video mail
* Live postcards
* Mobile listing ads
* Real-time digital ad insights
* Live virtual buyer events
* Enhanced 3D virtual staging

These are just some of the virtual services that we use. **To learn more about what each of them entails, stay tuned for our future videos and blogs.** If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
