We recently had a back-to-school drive for Mary’s Place. Mary’s Place is an organization that provides safe, inclusive shelter and services that support women, children, and families on their journey out of homelessness. **To continue our support, we are extending our back-to-school drive for the entire month of September.** Below, you’ll find links to the [supplies that are needed](https://www.marysplaceseattle.org/school-supplies){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [drop-off locations](https://www.marysplaceseattle.org/support-us/donation-drop-off){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, as well as a link to [Amazon to order supplies](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/charitylist/ls/QECMIW813WZ8/ref=smi_cl_lol_lls4_ls4){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and have them sent directly to Mary’s Place.

Our family and business have supported Mary's place in the past and will continue to do so in the future. **Their mantra is “No one's child should sleep outside.”** This is something that everyone can agree on. I love that they continue their support even after helping families transition out of homelessness by getting kids the supplies they need to go back to school.

Please consider supporting Mary’s Place with a donation. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.
