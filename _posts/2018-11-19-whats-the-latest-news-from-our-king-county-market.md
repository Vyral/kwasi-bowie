Inventory is increasing in our market, which is good news for buyers. It’s still a great time to be a seller, though, and here’s why.

As we take a look at our King County market through October, **we’re seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos.** We’re also seeing prices continue to appreciate at a rate of 6% to 6.5%.

The big news here is the increase in inventory. For residential homes, inventory has increased 86% year over year. For condos, it has increased 188% year over year.

**If you’re a buyer, this means you have more homes to choose from and you’ll be facing less competition.** If you enter the market now, you’ll also get a better interest rate than you would if you waited several months down the road. Since the Federal Reserve is planning on raising rates even more than they already have, they have nowhere to go but up.

**If you’re a seller, the good news is you don’t have to worry about the bottom dropping out due to this rise in inventory.** Why? Prices are still going up. Though they’re not spiking by double digits anymore, they’re still appreciating.
