We want to do our part and support one of our favorite local businesses.

We're hosting an event, check it out&nbsp;[here](https://calendly.com/kwasib/youngstown-supporters?month=2020-06). I’m always talking about hyperlocal real estate markets, which is a term for the market in your specific neighborhood or area. I recently joined a challenge with the West Seattle Junction, and I’m going to be doing a special event for Youngstown Coffee Company in my own hyperlocal market.

I’m happy to support them during these hard times, and I hope you'll join me in doing so as well. Small businesses matter, so let us know if you know anyone else we can help raise funds for right now. Stay tuned for further details on the Youngstown Coffee event. To hear my full message, watch this short video.
