<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s your February real estate market update.</em></p>

In King County, we’ve seen an increase in the number of homes for sale by 123%. Now, in Seattle, we've seen an increase of 131%.

What about the average sales price? Well, in King County, the average sales price decreased by 3.1%, and Seattle dropped by 2.9%.

For King County, we have 2.5 months of supply, which is 2.5% more than we had last year. Seattle has 2.1 months of supply, **but they’re up almost 300% from last year!**

We all remember what was going on last year, with the multiple offers right and left and crazy frenzies. **As fast as homes were selling then, the more inventory we have this year, the less we’ll see that sort of frenzied market.** But we won’t know exactly how much of a frenzy to expect until we see what happens in March, April, and May—that will determine the level of inventory and how quickly things sell.

Like I always say: There are a lot of steps to buying and selling a home in today’s market. The one step you need to remember is to give me a call, and I’ll help guide and advise you through the rest of the steps.
