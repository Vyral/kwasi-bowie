Spring and summer aren’t the only times you can find success in the home-selling world. Here are three benefits of selling in the fall and winter.

Many people think that the spring and summer are the only times that you can benefit from selling a home. That’s absolutely not true. **Here are three reasons to sell your Seattle home this fall or winter:**

**1. Less inventory.** More inventory means more competition, so listing in the fall and winter while there is less competition means that you’re more likely to sell.

**2. Motivated buyers.** During this time of year, buyers are motivated. Maybe they want to move by the holidays or maybe they have a new job starting in January and want to get settled. Whatever the reason, buyers are more motivated in general during this time of year.

**3. Marketing.** The Greater Puget Sound area is so gorgeous during the autumn and winter, and listing during this time is a great way to show off your home in the best light possible.
