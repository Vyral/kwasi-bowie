Would you believe me if I told you the number of closed sales in King County for March 2020 was 7% higher than last March? It’s true; here are the latest stats.

March was obviously a bizarre and difficult time for our area, our nation, and our world. Today, in keeping with my commitment to provide you with the most up-to-date information on our real estate market, I’m sharing the statistics from last month and comparing them to March 2019.

Active listings for King County fell by more than one-third—unsurprising, considering the circumstances. Thankfully, however, prices remained strong; King County saw prices increase by 3.6% from last year, and Seattle specifically saw a median sales price increase of 3.79%.
