        "content": "Inventory is increasing in our market, which is good news for buyers. Itâs still a great time to be a seller, though, and hereâs why.As we take a look at our King County market through October, weâre seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos. Weâre also seeing prices continue to appreciate at a rate of 6% to 6.5%.The big news here is the increase in inventory. For residential homes, inventory has increased 86% year over year. For condos, it has increased 188% year over year.If youâre a buyer, this means you have more homes to choose from and youâll be facing less competition. If you enter the market now, youâll also get a better interest rate than you would if you waited several months down the road. Since the Federal Reserve is planning on raising rates even more than they already have, they have nowhere to go but up.If youâre a seller, the good news is you donât have to worry about the bottom dropping out due to this rise in inventory. Why? Prices are still going up. Though theyâre not spiking by double digits anymore, theyâre still appreciating.âWeâre seeing more inventory and fewer pending sales for both residential homes and condos.âIf youâre looking to buy an investment property, make sure you know your numbers and you have a good idea of what your propertyâs value will be in the future, because the market wonât bail you out the way it would have in the past if you make a bad purchase.No matter what your real estate goals are, itâs most important to have an experienced real estate professional by your side so they can guide you through the process. If you have any more questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to help you.",

More inventory means more competition, so listing in the fall and winter while there is less competition means that youâre more likely to sell.2. Motivated buyers. During this time of year, buyers are motivated. Maybe they want to move by the holidays or maybe they have a new job starting in January and want to get settled. Whatever the reason, buyers are more motivated in general during this time of year.3. Marketing. The Greater Puget Sound area is so gorgeous during the autumn and winter, and listing during this time is a great way to show off your home in the best light possible.âBuyers are especially motivated during this time of year.âThere are a lot of things to know and a lot of steps to take when youâre thinking about buying or selling a home in a shifting market. The one thing that you need to remember is to give me a call or send me an email so I can help guide you through these steps. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "With all the hype about the article in the Seattle Times that mentioned dropping home prices and rising inventory, I want to update you on whatâs actually going on in the market.Thereâs been a lot of buzz about the Seattle Times article saying that the median home price in Seattle has dropped by $70,000 in the last three months, and that there was 66% more inventory in the market.Today Iâd like to address these statistics for everyone in the market.If youâre a seller, youâre likely seeing that there are more price reductions and more inventory in the market. Because of that, homes are taking just a little bit longer to sell. The fact of the matter is that homes that are positioned properly when they first come on the market are selling with multiple offers, sometimes even above asking price.If youâre a buyer, youâll also have noticed the increase in inventory, which means more options for you to choose from. You probably wonât see as many crazy multiple offer situations that you have earlier this year. Sellers are also more willing to accept contingent offers. Youâll also notice the surge in price reductions, which means you wonât have to rush to a given house and spend a lot of money on pre-inspections before you can get it.Renters, like buyers and sellers, will enjoy the upswing of inventory as well. You might see big apartment complexes offering incentives to renters, so itâs a good time to take advantage.âEven though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year.âWeâre also noticing more and more investors jumping back in the market, especially in the realm of single-family homes. There are some developers continuing to build; some were hesitant about the market, but the savvy ones are still in the game, looking for deals.Even with all this information, home prices are still up 2.9% over last year. Even though we lost some money in the Seattle market with the median home price, home prices are still up year over year. This is a healthy adjustment; weâre still below two months of supply in most areas, meaning itâs a sellerâs market.In our changing market, there are many steps to buying and selling a home. The first one you should take is to give me a call so I can help guide advise you through the rest of the steps. For any other questions, feel free to reach out to me.",

This is good news for buyer and sellers.As we make our way through June, what does our Seattle market look like for buyers and sellers?As Iâve been saying the past couple of months, inventory is increasing and pending sales are slowing down ever so slightly. Last month in King County, the number of active listings increased by 35%. As a whole, the Northwest MLS has not seen this kind of spike in new listings since May 2008. During the same time, the number of pending sales decreased 2.5%.With the increase in inventory weâre seeing, buyers have the opportunity to get the home they want without dealing with the frenzy they previously had to deal with.âInventory is increasing and pending sales are slowing down ever so slightly.âWhat about sellers, though? Despite the increase in inventory and the slight dip in pending sales, the median home price is still 14% higher than it was at this time last year. Weâre seeing great appreciation, but if you are a seller, you still need to make sure you work with an agent who has the knowledge to advise you in our shifting market.As I always say, there are a lot of things you need to know to navigate a shifting market like ours, but the one thing you need to remember is to give me a call so I can advise you through the rest of the steps.If you have any other questions about our current market or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

The area with the lowest average property tax that the article cited was Normandy Park, at a little over 9%. The area with the highest average was Carnation, at a little over 31%.What does this mean for homebuyers and homeowners?If you are a homeowner, keep an eye out for your property tax assessment in the mail. Whatever your increase is, you need to budget for it moving forward.If you are a homebuyer, be careful about the property taxes you are being quoted for any home you are interested in. You do not want the shock of moving into a house thinking you will have to make a certain payment next year only to have that payment increase, which will also increase your monthly mortgage payment.âProperty taxes in our area are about to go up.âAs always, there are many steps to buying or selling a home, but the one step you need to remember is to give me a call.

This means we should see an upcoming downward pressure on prices.Whatâs the latest news from our market?For the second month in a row, we saw inventory levels increase. This past April, we saw 12% more inventory come onto the market compared to April 2017. In the months prior to our recent stretch, we saw inventory levels undergo a double-digit drop.Sales, however, are down about 2%. Even though weâre absorbing a lot of the inventory coming onto the market, we havenât seen the same double-digit increase in pending sales that we did in the previous months where inventory dropped by double digits.âDownward pressure on prices means both buyers and sellers get a little more breathing room.âIf this trend continues, weâll soon see downward pressure on prices. This doesnât mean theyâll plummet or that a recession is on the horizon; it just means everyone gets a little more breathing room. Sellers will have more time to sell their homes.

Letâs get right to it.There was an article in the Seattle Times that said Seattleâs median home price is nearly $820,000 right now. There was another segment on KING 5 News that said if your Seattle home had a day job, it would be making $54.24 an hour. Isnât that amazing?Here are some numbers for King County. The median sale price is now up to $689,950 for single-family homes. Thatâs an increase of 15% in just the last year!âHomes are continuing to appreciate at an astonishing rate.âAnother interesting fact that came out was that we have seen quite a boost in inventory. With the spring and summer months, thatâs to be expected. However, our inventory is about 1% less than it was at this time last year, with about 1% more sales in the same time period.

Hereâs how you can get it.Thereâs still another step that people have to take beyond a pre-approval in order to be fully approved to buy a home. We have been recommending our clients to get pre-underwritten. This means you submit the same documentation as you do for a pre-approval, then you submit it to the underwriter, who goes through it with a fine-toothed comb. This gives the seller one less hurdle to worry about after they get under contract.âWe have more than 30 strategies to utilize, depending on your situation.âWe have more than 30 strategies to utilize, depending on your situation.
